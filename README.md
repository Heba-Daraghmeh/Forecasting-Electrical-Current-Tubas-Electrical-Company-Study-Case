# Forecasting Electrical Current – Tubas Electrical Company Case Study 

## Description
In this project, four predictive models were trained and tested using real data from Tubas Electrical Company. The goal was to compare the performance of these models and select the best one for further development.

The dataset provided by the company contained one year of hourly consumption data. However, this was not sufficient to accurately test the models' performance. To address this, we augmented the data to span four years, adding slight noise (≤ 0.05 of the original value) to simulate additional data.

The first part of this project, which includes the training and testing of the initial two models, was completed as part of my graduation project. The thesis for this work is available in the file project_thesis.pdf. The remaining part of the project was further developed to be written as a scientific paper, which is intended to support the master’s research of my teammate, Shorouq Abu-Khamees.
